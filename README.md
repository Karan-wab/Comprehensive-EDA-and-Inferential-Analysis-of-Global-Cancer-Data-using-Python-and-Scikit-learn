# Comprehensive-EDA-and-Inferential-Analysis-of-Global-Cancer-Data-using-Python-and-Scikit-learn
Data Analysis & Statistical Modeling: Analyzed a large-scale dataset of 50,000+ global patient records from 2015-2024 to identify key trends in cancer outcomes and risk factors.

Python Programming & Libraries: Leveraged Python, Pandas, and NumPy for comprehensive data cleaning, manipulation, and feature engineering on complex healthcare data.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Performed extensive EDA to uncover patterns in patient demographics, cancer stages, and lifestyle risk factors, creating visualizations with Matplotlib and Seaborn.

Inferential Statistics & Hypothesis Testing: Conducted formal hypothesis testing to validate assumptions and draw statistically significant conclusions from the data.

Predictive & Regression Modeling: Implemented a Multiple Linear Regression model using Python's statsmodels library to quantify the impact of genetic risk and smoking on cancer severity.

Data Visualization & Reporting: Designed and developed a range of data visualizations (histograms, box plots, heatmaps) to effectively communicate complex findings to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

Healthcare Analytics: Gained domain experience in healthcare analytics by working with clinical variables such as cancer type, stage, treatment cost, and survival years.

Actionable Insights: Translated raw data into actionable insights, concluding that there was no statistically significant interaction effect between genetic risk and smoking on patient outcomes in the dataset.
